# Welcome to BlankTheme

**BlankTheme is using Bootstrap and Zikula 1.3.7+**
Please check [its documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) to learn the cool features that you can use with your BlankTheme-based Theme.

---

BlankTheme aims to become a comprehensive Theme Development Framework for the Zikula Application Framework. Its objective is to ease the development of new Themes as well as the porting of open source themes.
We use the [Bootstrap front-end framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) to advance theme development and to create responsive, flexible, usable, valid and standards compliant themes.

Enjoy! We wait for your feedback ;-)
