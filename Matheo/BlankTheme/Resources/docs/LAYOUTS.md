# Available Layouts

The available layouts are supported by the body templates, located at the `Resources/views/body' subfolder, and are as follows:

## 2 colums (2col)

Supports all the available two column distributions, the main column at the left or right, with one of the side columns with the left/right blockpositions (by default).

## 3 columns (3col)

Supports all the available two column distributions, the main column at the left or right, with one of the side columns with the left/right blockpositions (by default).

## Grid (grid)

As an example of [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) there is a example of its use, with the main column at the left, taking the 60% of the total width, and the side columns the other 40%.

## Full width (full2col and full3col)

Is the same 2col and 3col templates except for the page structure to fill all the width.

BlankTheme also supports zones, which are in charge to handle custom blockpositions, and complete complex layouts.
